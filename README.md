# Next.js Express Backend Starter

This repository is a starter kit for building web applications with a Next.js frontend and an Express.js backend. It includes a simple API connection between the frontend and backend that displays "Hello, World."

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

```

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
   git clone https://github.com/ItsRayRay/Next.js-Express-Backend-Starter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Next.js-Express-Backend-Starter
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both the client and server:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server for both the client and server using a single command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Next.js frontend on port 3000 and the Express.js backend on port 8080. You can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Connection

The frontend makes a simple API request to the backend, which responds with "Hello, World." You can find the API call in the `pages/index.js` file in the frontend directory.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this starter kit to fit your specific project requirements. You can modify the client code in the `client` directory and the server code in the `server` directory. Add routes, components, and functionality as needed.

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your application, you can build the client and server separately and then deploy them to your hosting environment of choice.

To build the client:

```bash
npm run build:client
```

To build the server:

```bash
npm run build:server
```


```
